            <h3>HireVue Coordinate</h3>
            <p>To elimnate the hassle of back and forth with interview attendees that recruiters experience, I devised a plan for them to simply login to HireVue Coordinate and set up the interview from there. An email would automatically be sent to candidates and interviewers from which they would be directed to a landing page where they could self schedule. I their schedules were to change, this condition would not take away more time from the recruiter's desire to recruit. Instead, recruiters would receive a notification of a change as well as interviewers and they could adjust their own schedules accordingly.  </p>
